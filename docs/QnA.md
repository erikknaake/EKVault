# Questions and answers

__q:__ Why did you build this?

__a:__ Because I found myself having trouble with remembering passwords, personal passwords, but also up to 6 passwords per project up to 6 projects a year. I also started reusing passwords which of course is a bad idea, so I wrote this.

__q:__ Why isn't this free

__a:__ Because I had to write 2500 lines of code, fixed 75+ bugs and I had to write tests to prove it is all working to realise this, that costs a lot of time.

__q:__ How do you keep the quality of this project high?

__a:__ I use unit tests, tslint, SonarQube and a lot of manual testing

__q:__ How can I support this project

__a:__ Of course by using it, you pay for it, which is the main way to support me. If you want to do more donations are always welcome ;-)
In future releases I want to add translations for different languages, maybe you could help with translating to a language you know.
