Because we want everyone to be able to see we don't use an internet connection,
we went ahead and downloaded every font and icon so it can be served locally.

Because we want non techsavy people to be able to verify that EKVault indeed does not
use any internet connection we wrote this short guide.

1. Open this extension.
2. Press ```ctrl + shift + i``` or right click > inspect
3. Navigate to the ```Network``` tab.
4. Do whatever you like in the extension and see it doesn't make any network calls.
If any bar (green or blue) appears, a networkcall is made.
