What data do we use?

We use the url of the current open tab whenever you open EKVault,
so we can prefill the domain fields when loading, editing or saving a password. The hostname of the url
of the url is saved whenever you save a new password or edit a password. You can always edit
the domain field if you don't want a domain to be saved. Domains are encrypted together with the password and username.

We save the currently selected username whenever you
- Add a username
- Save a password with a username, this username gets encrypted with your passwords
We also use your provided username when loading a password.

We save the provided password, which is generated but can be edited.
Passwords are always stored in encrypted format.

For usability purposes we save your settings preferences, this includes:
- Your usernames.
- Your default username.
- Whether or not you use dark theme.
- Your password length, this is how many characters generated passwords contain.
- Your alphabet, this is the collection of characters used to chose from when generating a password.

In this document anything revered to as saving is either:

A: storing data in local storage.

B: exporting a file so it can be saved to your filesystem.
